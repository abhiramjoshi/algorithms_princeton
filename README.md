## Algorithms

The following repository is a collection of code written in the process of completing the coursework set in the Algorithms Part1 and Part2 courses from Princeton. Taught by Robert Sedgewick

All code in this course was written in Java. As a Python programmer using Java for the first time, this also added to the learning curve of the coursework. Though in general the assignments are extremely well planned and provoke a lot of critical thinking! 

Hop anyone coming across this repo can take some inspiration and learn something from my code to implement something better themselves!
